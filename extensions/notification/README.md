# Notification Extension

Enable audio notifications for assistant responses — beep, TTS speech, or both.

## Install

This extension is part of **[Slnc_Pi](../../README.md)** and is installed by the parent package. From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
pi install .
```

`npm install` installs this package's runtime dependencies for local path installs. Then restart pi or run `/reload` if pi is already running.

## Quick Start

Run `/notification` inside pi to open the interactive configuration menu. Navigate with ↑↓, press Enter to select or drill into submenus, and Escape to go back.

## Menu Structure

- **Mode** — Choose `off`, `beep`, `tts`, or `both`
- **Engine** — Select and configure a TTS engine:
  - `fish` — High-quality streaming TTS via Fish Audio WebSocket (requires API key)
  - `openai-compatible` — OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/speech` providers
  - `windows-native` — Local Windows SAPI (no key required, Windows only)
  - `vllm-omni` — Local vLLM-Omni server (S2-Pro) via WebSocket streaming PCM audio
- **TTS Output** — Configure how TTS handles output:
  - **Output Style** — `verbose` (full output, default) or `shortened` (LLM-summarized before TTS)
  - **Select summarizer model** — Pick an LLM from models available via `/model`
  - **Set skip threshold** — Responses shorter than N sentences skip summarization (default: 4)
- **Debug** — Test beep playback and TTS synthesis
- **Status** — Show current configuration summary

## TTS Summarization

When `shortened` output style is active, long responses are summarized by the configured model before TTS, making them much easier to listen to (tables, code, and verbose output are condensed to 3–5 sentences). The summary is shown below the final output as a dim custom message and is not sent to the LLM as chat context.

## vLLM-Omni Setup

Before using the `vllm-omni` engine you need a running vLLM-Omni server (e.g. S2-Pro) accessible at the configured base URL (default `http://localhost:8091`). Once the server is running:

1. Run `/notification` → Engine → `vllm-omni`
2. **Browse audio (.wav)** — pick your voice reference `.wav` file
3. **Browse transcript (.txt)** — pick the matching transcript (optional but recommended)
4. **Test server connection** — verify the server is reachable
5. **Upload & cache voice** — upload and cache the voice on the server
6. **Test TTS playback** — play a short test sentence to confirm everything works

Voice name is auto-derived from the audio filename. The transcript is read from the selected `.txt` file.

## Startup Flag

Override the notification mode at launch:

```bash
pi --notification beep   # or tts, both, off
```

## Configuration Reference (from docs/CONFIG.md)

### Interactive Menu

Run `/notification` to open the drill-down configuration menu:

- **↑↓** — Navigate items
- **Enter** — Select action or enter submenu
- **Esc** — Go back one level (or close at root)

Menu sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Mode** | Set notification mode: `off`, `beep`, `tts`, `both` |
| **Engine** | Select TTS engine and configure per-engine settings |
| **TTS Output** | Configure how TTS handles output (verbose vs. summarized) |
| **Debug** | Test beep playback and TTS synthesis |
| **Status** | Show current configuration summary |

### Engine Configuration

Each engine has its own submenu under **Engine**:

**fish:**
- Select fish
- Set API key (value is never displayed)
- Clear API key
- Set reference ID
- Set model

**openai-compatible:**
- Select openai-compatible
- Set API key (value is never displayed)
- Clear API key
- Set base URL
- Set model
- Set voice

**windows-native:**
- Select windows-native

**vllm-omni:**
- Select vllm-omni
- Browse audio (.wav) — pick a reference audio file via file dialog
- Browse transcript (.txt) — pick the transcript file (optional but recommended)
- Test server connection — verify the server at `http://localhost:8091` is reachable
- Upload & cache voice — upload the audio to the server and cache the voice
- Test TTS playback — synthesize and play a short test sentence

Voice name is auto-derived from the audio file name (e.g. `my_voice.wav` → `my_voice`).
The transcript is read directly from the selected `.txt` file.

### TTS Output Configuration

Under **TTS Output**:

- **Output Style** — Choose `verbose` (read full output) or `shortened` (summarize before TTS)
- **Select summarizer model** — Pick an LLM model from those available via `/model` (must have auth configured)
- **Set skip threshold (sentences)** — Responses shorter than this many sentences are not summarized (default: 4)

When `shortened` is active, the assistant response is sent to the configured summarizer model as a separate API call. The summarizer returns a 3-5 sentence spoken summary, shown below the final output as a dim custom message that is not sent to the LLM as chat context. If the summarizer call fails, an error is shown and TTS is skipped for that message.

### Settings File

Settings are persisted to `~/.pi/agent/notification.json` (via `getAgentDir()`).

#### Configuration Fields

- `mode`: Notification behavior.
  - `off`: No notifications.
  - `beep`: Play a sound at the end of a response.
  - `tts`: Read the final response using the configured TTS engine.
  - `both`: Beep and read the response at the end.
- `ttsEngine`: The engine used for speech synthesis.
  - `fish`: High-quality streaming TTS (Fish Audio).
  - `openai-compatible`: OpenAI-compatible TTS API.
  - `windows-native`: Local Windows SAPI using the system default voice.
  - `vllm-omni`: Local vLLM-Omni server (S2-Pro) via WebSocket streaming.
- `fish`:
  - `apiKey`: API key for Fish Audio.
  - `referenceId`: The voice reference ID to use.
  - `model`: The synthesis model (e.g., `s2-pro`).
- `openAiCompatible`:
  - `apiKey`: API key for the provider.
  - `baseUrl`: The API base URL.
  - `model`: The TTS model to use.
  - `voice`: The voice name/ID.

  - `refTextPath`: Path to the transcript `.txt` file (read automatically, no typing needed).
  - `voiceCached`: Whether the voice has been uploaded to the server.

- `ttsOutputMode`: How TTS handles the assistant output.
  - `verbose`: Read the full response as-is (default).
  - `shortened`: Send the response to an LLM summarizer first, then read the summary. Skips summarization if the response has fewer sentences than `summarizer.skipThreshold`.
- `summarizer`:

### Environment Variables

API keys can be provided via environment variables to override stored settings:
- `PI_NOTIFICATION_FISH_API_KEY` or `FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY`
- `PI_NOTIFICATION_OPENAI_TTS_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Emote Synchronization

When both the notification and pi-emote extensions are installed, the emote's mouth animation syncs to TTS audio:

| Mode | Emote behavior during streaming | Emote behavior during TTS |
|---|---|---|
| `off` | Mouth animates per token, goes idle when streaming ends | N/A |
| `beep` | Mouth animates per token, goes idle when streaming ends | N/A |
| `tts` | Stays in think/tool/idle states (no streaming talk) | Mouth animates for full playback duration |
| `both` | Stays in think/tool/idle states (no streaming talk) | Mouth animates for full playback duration |
